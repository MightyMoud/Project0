# Project0 
This is a conversion from a PSD template with Vanilla CSS/HTML

This is my project hence the project0 title. This is based on a PSD design passed on a friend of mine as a test for an entry level job in FE. 

I haven't used any CSS fraweworks or any HTML helpers. Just basic VSCODE stuff. I wanted to learn more about my style in writing HTML and CSS. Surely I learned a lot about my style especially in CSS. Loved writing those 550+ lines, but if I had the chance I'd probable delete them all and start all over again! ðŸ˜‚

Below you can the .jpeg design that I started with.
